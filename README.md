# Predicting car accident severity using machine learning
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/joseferncruz/coursera-capstone/master)

This project is part of the [IBM Data Science Certification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) offered via coursera.


## Introduction

In this project I intend to develop a machine learning model to predict severity of an accident by using different data attributes such as weather, road condition, date, individuals involved, etc.

This project will use publicly available data collected by the Seattle Police Department and recorded by Traffic Records.



## Getting Started

To run this repository please:  

1) Download or clone this repository using [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2) Install a python environment with jupyter notebooks/lab such as, for instance, [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).


## Using the material in this repository

In the folder `notebooks/` you will soon can find the complete notebooks used for:  

`notebooks/ibm_capstone_nb01.ipynb`: Introduction, Loading data, EDA and Preprocessing

`notebooks/ibm_capstone_nb02.ipynb`: Modeling and Conclusions

In the folder `docs/` you will find the metadata associated with the main dataset found in the folder `datasets/`
