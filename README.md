## Introduction

In this project, I used publicly available data from the Seattle Police Department to understand the problem and develop metrics that can be used to reduce car accident severity. Results from this project could be used to design and implement new public policies aiming at reducing injury-related accidents.
To execute this project

Briefly, to tackle this issue I performed exploratory data analysis and developed a machine learning model to understand and predict accident accident's severity using different data attributes such as weather, road condition, date, individuals involved, among others.

The execution of this project followed the [**Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)**](https://www.sv-europe.com/crisp-dm-methodology/) methodology.

This project is based on publicly available data collected by the Seattle Police Department and recorded by [Traffic Records](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/collisions).


## Repository contents

In the folder `notebooks/` you can find the complete notebook used for exploratory data analysis and modeling:  

`notebooks/ibm_capstone_nb01.ipynb`

The dataset used is located under the directory `datasets/` and the metadata associated is located under the directory `docs/`:  

`datasets/collisions_data.csv`  
`docs/collisions_metadata.pdf`


## The code

This project was executed using python 3 and jupyter notebooks.
